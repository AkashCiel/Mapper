Hello, this repository is a personal project of mine. 
I am interested in the feedback loop which exists between the physiology of our bodies and the state of our minds. 
In other words, what goes on in our minds impacts our bodies and vice-versa. 

This repository is an android application, which enables the user to log their mental and physical state at a given moment. 
It contains an additional activity to keep a log of one's dreams, as I believe our dreams are a reflection of our physiology and mental state.
